# 3D-face-reconstruction
In this work, I present a method for stereo-based 3D
face reconstruction. The algorithm is based on depth estimation
of the face by using image pair which are taken from different
point of views. Afterwards, surface mesh of the face is generated
by deploying this depth information. In order to improve
the depth estimation, I take advantage of the face properties.
